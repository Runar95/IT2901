A bacherlor's degree project made in cooperation with the **Lim**(Language, Integration and Media) research group at NTNU. The project aims to create an educational game that can be played in a classroom-setting. The main goal of the game is to be a low threshold opportunity for students from different backgrounds to talk to one another and to provide some information about different cultures. 

###### How to deploy the game
**Step 1:**
Download the gamedevelopment engine *unity* from [this](https://store.unity.com/download) link.
We use version *2018.3.3f1 Personal*, but newer versions should also work.

Download the project from this repository. If you are familiar with github, you can download it with the terminal. If you are new to github however, you can download it by clicking the *clone or download* button on the main page of the repository. Afterwards, press *Download ZIP*
